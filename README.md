## Description

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/evswuysba175qlb/IMW.png?dl=1)

Iracing metric weather is a simple userscript that converts event result page weather from imperial to metric units. You will not need to use any online conversor to know how cold/hot was your last race which you ~~crashed~~ won.

## Install

Before you can use this script, you need to install a plugin in your favourite browser called [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome).
Then you only have to click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Che931/iracing-metric-weather/master/iracing-metric-weather.user.js) and confirm that you want to install it.
